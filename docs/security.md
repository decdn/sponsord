## What holds what

| Secret | Where | Can do |
|---|---|---|
| Treasury key (keystore + password) | `sponsord` host | Sign capabilities against your pool; move the wallet's funds |
| `SPONSORD_API_TOKEN` | `sponsord`, the onramp, your gate | Get a capability for any key, up to the daemon's maximum terms |
| Turnstile secret | the onramp | Verify captcha tokens |
| A download key | the user's machine, one per download | Spend up to its capability's cap, until it expires |

The treasury key both owns the pool and pays for top-ups
(`PaymentPool.topUp` is owner-only), so a compromised daemon host loses the
wallet's funds as well as the pool. Keep only what the next few top-ups need
in that wallet. Splitting the two is tracked in
[#25](https://github.com/decdn/sponsord/issues/25).

## What bounds a loss

Anyone who gets capabilities can spend, at most:

- **per capability:** its cap (`SPONSORD_MAX_SPENDING_CAP_MICRO_USDC`, or
  the onramp's lower `ONRAMP_SPENDING_CAP_MICRO_USDC`), until its expiry;
- **in total:** what's in the pool. The keeper tops it up by
  `SPONSORD_POOL_REFILL_MICRO_USDC` whenever it falls below the low-water
  mark, so what's in the treasury wallet is the real ceiling.

How many capabilities they can get is bounded by the gate, and on the onramp
by the per-address rate limits (`ONRAMP_FUND_RATE_PER_MIN`).

## Hardening checklist

- Keep `sponsord` unreachable from the internet; only the onramp (or your
  gate) talks to it. It binds to localhost by default.
- Give secrets as files (`*_FILE`, systemd credentials, Docker secrets), not
  environment variables. `Debug` output never prints them.
- Behind a reverse proxy, set `ONRAMP_CLIENT_IP_HEADER` only if the proxy is
  the only way to reach the onramp; otherwise clients choose their own
  address. With `X-Forwarded-For` the right-most address counts.
- Watch `sponsord_pool_topups_total` and the treasury balance: a spike in
  top-ups means capabilities are being spent faster than expected.
- Pin releases: the installers check each release's `SHA256SUMS` against a
  digest you set (`ONRAMP_*_SUMS_SHA256`), so a release asset replaced after
  you pinned it is refused.
- Every value baked into the installers is validated at startup to hold no
  character a quoted shell or PowerShell string could misread.

## The CLI

`decdn-sponsored` keeps each download's key, password, capability and
profile under `~/.decdn/sponsored/downloads/<hash>/`, created `0700` with
files `0600` on Unix. The key holds no funds and is deleted once the
download succeeds. `decdn` verifies every byte against the content hash, so
a malicious node or onramp can't change what is downloaded; a malicious
onramp could only point the CLI at a different pool or chain.
