# sponsord

`sponsord` is deCDN's sponsored on-ramp: a gateway (`sponsord`) that grants a
new client a zero-tx allowance against its own shared `PaymentPool` on the
Arbitrum Sepolia testnet, so a new user can fetch content from the network
without first acquiring testnet USDC, opening a channel, or setting up a
wallet by hand. The sponsor owns a single `PaymentPool`, opened out-of-band
via `decdn pool open` (its id given by `SPONSOR_POOL_ID`) — the gateway never
opens anything per user. A captcha-gated `/fund` flow issues an owner-signed
EIP-712 capability (serialized as a `dcap1:` token) authorizing the caller's
key to redeem against that pool up to a per-capability cap: zero on-chain
transaction and zero locked deposit per user. A companion CLI
(`decdn-sponsored`, in `crates/wrapper`) gives each download a throwaway key,
obtains a capability for it, and hands the pull to the `decdn` binary. The
gateway never sees that key. See `../decdn` for the protocol and contracts
this all sits on top of.

Capabilities are node-agnostic: issuance doesn't involve a content hash or
node discovery, only an allowance against the shared pool. Registration of a
signer against the pool is set-once on-chain — once a key first redeems, its
cap and expiry are frozen for that key, which is why `decdn-sponsored` uses
one key per download, and why `/fund` answers `409 signer_registered` instead
of renewing an expired capability for a key that has already redeemed.
Anti-abuse is bounded by the captcha on `/fund`, the per-capability cap
(`SPONSOR_CAPABILITY_CAP_MICRO_USDC`), and the shared pool's own balance — there's no per-signer monthly accumulator.

## Crates

- `crates/server` (binary `sponsord`) — the HTTP gateway: `/healthz`,
  `/decdn.sh` and `/decdn.ps1` (templated installers for macOS/Linux and
  Windows), `/fund` (captcha page + capability
  issuance), `/capability` (poll for an issued capability).
- `crates/wrapper` (binary `decdn-sponsored`) — the end-user CLI: reads
  `~/.decdn/sponsor.toml` (written by the installer), obtains a capability
  for a per-download throwaway key, then runs `decdn bundle pull` against the
  shared pool.

## Running the server

```bash
export SPONSOR_RPC_URL=https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc
export SPONSOR_PAYMENT_POOL_ADDR=0x...
export SPONSOR_POOL_ID=0x...
export SPONSOR_CAPACITY_BOND_ADDR=0x...
export SPONSOR_TREASURY_KEYSTORE=/path/to/treasury-keystore.json
export SPONSOR_TREASURY_PASSWORD=...
export SPONSOR_TURNSTILE_SECRET=...
export SPONSOR_TURNSTILE_SITEKEY=...
export SPONSOR_DECDN_RELEASE=v0.1.0
export SPONSOR_DECDN_SUMS_SHA256=...
export SPONSOR_WRAPPER_RELEASE=v0.1.0
export SPONSOR_WRAPPER_SUMS_SHA256=...
cargo run -p sponsord
```

The pool itself is opened out-of-band, once, via `decdn pool open` from the
treasury wallet; `SPONSOR_POOL_ID` just tells `sponsord` which existing pool
to issue capabilities against. `sponsord` never opens a pool itself.

`sponsord` binds `SPONSOR_BIND` (default `127.0.0.1:8080`), serves the HTTP
routes below, and spawns a background task (`pool_watch::run`) that tops the
pool up from the treasury whenever its remaining balance falls below
`SPONSOR_POOL_LOW_WATER_MICRO_USDC`, checking every
`SPONSOR_POOL_WATCH_INTERVAL_SECS`.

## The `decdn-sponsored` flow

The website shows one command per model, with the model's BLAKE3 hash and
the namespace it is published under, both from `models.json`. On macOS and
Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://up.decdn.org/decdn.sh | sh -s -- pull b3:<hash> --namespace <id>
```

On Windows (x64 and ARM64), in PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://up.decdn.org/decdn.ps1 | iex; decdn-sponsored pull b3:<hash> --namespace <id>
```

1. The installer served at `GET /decdn.sh` (`assets/decdn.sh`), or its
   PowerShell twin at `GET /decdn.ps1` (`assets/decdn.ps1`), installs the
   `decdn` and `decdn-sponsored` binaries straight from their pinned GitHub
   Releases. It downloads each release's `SHA256SUMS`, checks it against the
   pinned digest, then checks the platform's archive against `SHA256SUMS`;
   nothing is installed unless both match. It then writes
   `~/.decdn/sponsor.toml` with the gateway's contract addresses and RPC URL
   filled in. Any
   arguments are passed on to `decdn-sponsored`. Running it again is
   harmless, and `decdn-sponsored pull ...` works on its own once installed.
2. `decdn-sponsored pull <hash> [-o <dir>] [--namespace <id>]` (output
   defaults to the current directory) opens the state directory for that hash, `~/.decdn/sponsored/downloads/<hash>/`, and generates a throwaway
   voucher-signing key there with a random password stored beside it. The
   user never sees a key, keystore, or password.
3. It polls `GET /capability?client=<addr>` and, while that answers `204`,
   prints (and opens in the browser) `GET /fund?client=<addr>` for the
   captcha. The issued `dcap1:` token is saved in the state directory.
4. It runs `decdn bundle pull --hash <hash> -o <dir> --capability-file ...
   --keystore ... --data-dir <state dir>` with inherited stdio, so `decdn`'s
   own progress and errors reach the user unchanged. The name-to-hash
   mapping happens on the website; the CLI accepts only a hash, and `decdn`
   verifies every byte against it. `--namespace` is passed through as-is: it
   lets a node that has not cached the bundle pull from that namespace's
   origins, and never changes which bytes are accepted.
5. On success the state directory is deleted. On failure it is kept: running
   the same command again resumes with the same key and capability (no new
   captcha), and `bundle pull` resumes from its `.partial` files. A saved
   capability within five minutes of expiry is replaced by a fresh key and
   a new captcha.

The `~/.decdn/sponsor.toml` schema is a hard contract between the installer
(`assets/decdn.sh`, `assets/decdn.ps1`) and the wrapper
(`crates/wrapper/src/config.rs`): field
names must match exactly. Current fields: `gateway_base`, `decdn_bin`,
`data_dir`, `rpc_url`, `payment_pool`, `capacity_bond` (optional),
`slash_judge` (optional), `chain_id`. Unknown fields are ignored.

## Building against `decdn`

The workspace path-depends on its sibling `decdn` checkout
(`../decdn/crates/*`), so a local build uses whatever that checkout holds.
CI checks out `decdn/decdn` beside this repo: `main` by default, or any ref a
manual run names (`decdn_ref`), so breakage from `decdn` changes shows up
early. Releases build against the commit pinned in `decdn.ref` instead, so a
tag always builds the same code.

## Releasing

1. Point `decdn.ref` at the `decdn` commit (full SHA) or tag to build
   against, and make sure `Cargo.lock` is consistent with it
   (`cargo metadata --locked` with that commit checked out beside this repo).
2. Push a `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-pre]` tag. `.github/workflows/release.yml`
   builds `decdn-sponsored` for Linux, macOS and Windows (x86_64 and
   aarch64 each) and `sponsord` for Linux, and publishes them with a
   `SHA256SUMS` manifest as a GitHub Release.
3. The release notes print the `SPONSOR_WRAPPER_RELEASE` and
   `SPONSOR_WRAPPER_SUMS_SHA256` values that pin it. Set them on the gateway
   to make the installers serve it. `decdn` releases are pinned the same way
   (`SPONSOR_DECDN_RELEASE`, and `SPONSOR_DECDN_SUMS_SHA256` = the SHA-256 of
   that release's `SHA256SUMS`).
