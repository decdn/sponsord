# The image list lives in release_plan.py (which crate's release carries which
# image). These must agree with it:
#   * Dockerfile                — one final target per image (`FROM base AS <image>`)
#   * release.yml's docker job  — per image, pushes `ghcr.io/<owner>/<image>`
#                                 and writes <image>-image-digest.txt
#   * sign-release.sh           — validates that file against the same name,
#                                 then tags from it
#   * security.yml's scan matrix
#
# A mismatch is otherwise caught only when sign-release.sh rejects a digest
# file — after a full release build, with the tag already pushed.
#
# This lives in a script rather than inline in the workflow ON PURPOSE. GitHub
# Actions expands `${{ … }}` inside a `run:` block before bash ever sees it, so
# an inline grep for the literal `${{ github.repository_owner }}` searches for
# the expanded value instead and never matches. In a file the runner does not
# template, single quotes mean what they say.
