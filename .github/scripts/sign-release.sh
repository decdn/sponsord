# Signs and publishes a release draft staged by .github/workflows/release.yml.
#
# Each crate is released on its own, from a `<crate>-v<version>` tag, and
# release_plan.py says what that crate's release carries: the archives and
# SHA256SUMS (sponsord, sponsord-onramp, decdn-sponsored), a container image
# with its SBOM and digest file (sponsord, sponsord-onramp), or nothing but the
# notes (sponsord-core, where the signed tag is the attestation).
#
# The workflow builds all of that but signs nothing and publishes nothing — the
# GitHub Release is left as a draft and the image manifest is pushed untagged.
# This script is the human step: a maintainer verifies what CI produced, signs
# it with their own GPG key, promotes the image tags, and publishes. There is no
# signing key in Actions secrets.
#
# Usage:  .github/scripts/sign-release.sh decdn-sponsored-v0.1.2
#
# Environment:
#   SPONSORD_REPO            override the owner/repo (default: decdn/sponsord)
#   SPONSORD_SIGNING_KEY     key to sign with (default: gpg's default secret key).
#                            Whatever it resolves to must be published in KEYS.
#   SPONSORD_SKIP_IMAGE_TAGS set to 1 to publish without creating ANY pullable
#                            image tag — the release then ships with only the
#                            signed digest in its <image>-image-digest.txt
#   SPONSORD_SKIP_DOCKERHUB  set to 1 to tag on GHCR only, skipping the Docker
#                            Hub mirror (implied by SPONSORD_SKIP_IMAGE_TAGS)
#   SPONSORD_DOCKERHUB_NAMESPACE  override the Docker Hub namespace the image
#                            is mirrored under (default: the repo owner)
#
# Re-running is safe at any point before the release is published: signatures
# are re-uploaded with --clobber and the tag promotion is idempotent. Once the
# release is out of draft the script refuses to run again.
