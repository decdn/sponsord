#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Publishes the workspace to crates.io, after sign-release.sh has published the
# GitHub Release. Every crate shares the version the tag (`v<version>`) names,
# and every publishable member goes up in one `cargo publish --workspace` run.
#
# Like signing, this is a human step with no counterpart in Actions: there is no
# crates.io token in Actions secrets, and a `push`-triggered workflow runs the
# workflow definition from the pushed ref, so a token reachable from release.yml
# would be reachable from any tag anyone with push access could craft.
#
# Usage:  .github/scripts/publish-crates.sh v0.1.2
#
# The uploaded manifests resolve every path and git dependency by its
# `version`. The siblings go up in this same run, in dependency order; the
# decdn crates must already be on crates.io, from the decdn release whose tag
# is the commit Cargo.lock pins (registry_deps.py lists them). The readiness
# check below refuses until then.
#
# Environment:
#   SPONSORD_REPO             override the owner/repo (default: decdn/sponsord)
#   SPONSORD_SIGNING_KEY      key the tag is expected to be signed by (default:
#                             any key published in KEYS)
#   CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN      crates.io token, if not in the cargo credentials file
#   SPONSORD_ALLOW_RATE_LIMIT set to 1 to publish more than 5 brand-new crates
#                             in one run — only once crates.io has raised your
#                             account's publish-new limit (see the check below)
#
# Unlike sign-release.sh this is NOT freely re-runnable: a crates.io version is
# immutable and can never be replaced or re-uploaded (only yanked, which does
# not free the version). If it fails partway, the crates already uploaded stay
# uploaded — see the recovery note printed on failure.
